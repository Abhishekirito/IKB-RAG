<h1 id="overview">📌 Overview</h1>

IKB-RAG is a full-stack AI-powered Industrial Knowledge Assistant that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with multimodal document understanding to help engineers diagnose industrial equipment failures quickly and accurately.

Unlike traditional chatbots, IKB-RAG understands:

- 📄 Industrial manuals
- 📊 Tables
- 📈 Technical diagrams
- 🧮 Mathematical formulas
- 📝 Maintenance reports

using **MinerU's multimodal parsing engine**, stores document embeddings inside **Qdrant Cloud**, and generates contextual expert responses through **Groq's Llama 3 models**.

The result is an intelligent troubleshooting assistant capable of delivering highly accurate answers with precise document citations.

<h1 id="rag-pipeline">🧠 RAG Pipeline</h1>

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline is designed specifically for industrial documentation, where preserving structure and context is essential.

---

## 📄 Step 1 — Document Parsing

Every uploaded PDF is processed by **MinerU**, which extracts:

- 📄 Paragraphs
- 📊 Tables
- 📈 Engineering Charts
- 🖼 Diagrams
- 🧮 Mathematical Formulae
- 📑 Document Layout
- 🔤 OCR Text

Unlike traditional PDF parsers, MinerU preserves the structural hierarchy of technical documents.

---

## ✂ Step 2 — Intelligent Chunking

Instead of splitting documents by arbitrary token limits, the engine separates content based on structural elements.

Each chunk represents:

- One paragraph
- One table
- One image
- One formula
- One engineering block

This significantly improves retrieval precision.

---

## 🧬 Step 3 — Embedding Generation

Each extracted chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector using:

**Nomic Embed Text v1.5**

Benefits include:

- Semantic similarity
- Fast vector search
- Context preservation
- High retrieval accuracy

---

## ☁ Step 4 — Vector Storage

Embeddings are stored inside **Qdrant Cloud**.

Each vector stores:

- Chat ID
- PDF filename
- Page number
- Chunk type
- Source citation
- Metadata

This enables efficient filtering and scalable search.

---

## 🔎 Step 5 — Semantic Retrieval

When a question is asked:

1. Generate query embedding
2. Search nearest vectors
3. Retrieve highest-scoring chunks
4. Reconstruct surrounding context
5. Send enriched prompt to Groq

---

## 🧩 Parent Document Retrieval

Instead of sending isolated chunks to the LLM, the engine retrieves the surrounding page or section to provide additional context.

Benefits:

- Better reasoning
- Reduced hallucinations
- Improved engineering accuracy
- More natural answers

---

## 🤖 Step 6 — LLM Response Generation

Groq's Llama 3 model receives:

- User question
- Retrieved context
- Source metadata
- Industrial system prompt

The model generates an expert-level troubleshooting response while maintaining strict industrial guardrails.

---

<h1 id="ai-guardrails">🔒 AI Guardrails</h1>

The assistant is intentionally restricted to industrial engineering domains.

It will:

✅ Explain industrial equipment

✅ Analyze manuals

✅ Diagnose failures

✅ Provide maintenance guidance

✅ Perform Root Cause Analysis

It refuses:

❌ General knowledge

❌ Casual conversations

❌ Irrelevant programming queries

❌ Off-topic requests

unless directly related to industrial systems.

---

<h1 id="frontend-features">💻 Frontend Features</h1>

The frontend is built using **React + Vite** with a modern glassmorphism interface.

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### ✨ Glassmorphism Design

- Frosted panels
- Gradient accents
- Soft shadows

```
Uploading PDF...

Parsing Layout...

Extracting Tables...

Extracting Images...

Generating Embeddings...

Uploading to Qdrant...

Ready!
```

---
