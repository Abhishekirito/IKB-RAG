# IKB-RAG: Project Progress & Technology Matrix

This document outlines the current state of the IKB-RAG platform based on the required "Suggested Technologies" for the hackathon. It provides a clear view of what has been successfully engineered and what the future phases of development hold.

## ✅ Phase 1: Fully Achieved Capabilities

The following technologies have been successfully integrated into the core architecture of IKB-RAG, establishing a highly robust, scalable, and intelligent baseline.

### 1. RAG over heterogeneous industrial document corpora
* **Implementation:** We transitioned from local, volatile storage to **Qdrant Cloud**, allowing for persistent and highly scalable vector storage.
* **Result:** The system seamlessly ingests complex engineering PDFs (like OEM manuals and SOPs), generates vectors via Hugging Face embeddings, and utilizes Groq (Llama-3) to rapidly synthesize accurate, context-aware answers.

### 2. Computer Vision (P&ID parsing, drawing digitisation)
* **Implementation:** Integrated the **MinerU Multimodal Pipeline** as a remote Hugging Face microservice.
* **Result:** The system successfully detects, extracts, and digitizes complex Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) and figures embedded inside PDFs. These images are base64-encoded, saved locally, and dynamically served directly into the chat interface whenever a user references them.

### 3. OCR & Document Intelligence (structured + unstructured)
* **Implementation:** Completely replaced naive text splitting with an intelligent **Semantic Chunker**. 
* **Result:** By parsing MinerU's native `content_list.json`, the engine differentiates between standard paragraphs, complex HTML tables, and mathematical equations. It also precisely tracks the `page_idx` of every element, enabling hyper-accurate source citations that open the exact page of a PDF in a new browser tab.

### 4. Agentic AI for maintenance and compliance workflows
* **Implementation:** Designed a **Multi-Agent Architecture** containing a Query Router and a Dynamic QA Decomposer directly inside the RAG engine.
* **Result:** When a user asks a question, the Router Agent intercepts it. Simple questions use standard RAG (saving tokens/latency). Complex, multi-part troubleshooting questions trigger the Decomposer Agent, which autonomously breaks the question into 2-4 independent sub-queries (via strict JSON mode). It then queries the vector database for each sub-query individually, aggregates the deep context, and generates a massive, highly-accurate Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Checklist.

## 🟡 Phase 2: Foundation Laid (In Progress)

The following technologies have their foundational infrastructure completed and are ready for full execution.

### 5. Knowledge Graphs & Industrial Ontology Engineering
* **Implementation:** We currently utilize high-speed Vector Semantic Search, which perfectly retrieves unstructured data. The extraction of structured relationships is the next logical step.
* **Next Steps:** Passing the extracted P&ID diagrams to a Vision LLM to autonomously map component topologies (e.g., *Pump A is upstream of Valve B*), and storing that ontology in **Neo4j AuraDB** to enable GraphRAG capabilities.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Future Integration (Not Yet Achieved)

These technologies represent the final tier of enterprise integration for the IKB-RAG platform.

### 6. Quality Management System (QMS) Integration
* **Status:** Not yet initiated.
* **Future Vision:** Building an API bridge (or utilizing Webhooks) so that when the Agentic AI identifies a critical failure, it can automatically dispatch a structured JSON payload to an external QMS platform (like SAP QM, Maximo, Jira, or a Slack channel) to officially log a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) or maintenance work order.
